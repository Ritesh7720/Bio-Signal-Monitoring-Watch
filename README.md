# Bio-Signal-Monitoring-Watch
We have made a wearable, compact, low power consumption, real-time remote tracking device for four bio-signals monitoring namely Temperature, Heart Beat per minute, Blood oxygen saturation, and electrocardiogram(for expanding our project to the heart patients). The bio signals captured by sensors will be transmitted from the monitoring device over Wi-Fi to a local web server and to a firebase real time database which can be accessed by the Monitoring team/Family member by a simple and easily understandable application with a notification alarming system. It’s important to take into account that not everyone owns a smartphone, and elderly people often face difficulties in using modern gadgets, such as mobile phones. So, they can also track their vitals through the OLED screen and keep better track of their health.
